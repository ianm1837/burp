First, you need to install Multer using npm:

Copy code
npm install multer
After installing Multer, you can create a route in your application that handles the image upload. In the example below, we assume you are using Express as your server framework.

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const app = express();

// Set up the Multer storage engine
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'public/uploads/')
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + Date.now())
  }
})

// Create the Multer upload object
const upload = multer({ storage: storage })

// Define the route that handles the image upload
app.post('/upload', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  // Handle the uploaded image
  console.log(req.file); // This will log the information about the uploaded image
  res.send('Image uploaded successfully!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
In this example, we have defined a route /upload that handles the image upload. We created a Multer storage engine that specifies where the uploaded files should be stored and what they should be named. In this example, the files are stored in the public/uploads/ directory, and each file is named with its original field name followed by a timestamp. We then created a Multer upload object using this storage engine.

The upload.single('image') middleware is used to specify that we are uploading a single file with the field name image. The uploaded file information is stored in the req.file object. We can then handle the uploaded image as needed.

To use this feature in your front-end, you will need to create a form that allows users to select an image file and submit it to the server. Here is an example HTML form:

html
Copy code
<form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="image">
  <input type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
This form creates a file input that allows users to select an image file from their device. The enctype="multipart/form-data" attribute is used to specify that this form contains binary data. When the user submits the form, it will be sent to the /upload route defined in the server code, where Multer will handle the image upload.
