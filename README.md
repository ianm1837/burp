# 02-Project

This project was created to demonstrate an important milestone in our full-stack bootcamp: Designing and building our first full-stack web application. We have designed and built an app using the MVC paradign, created our own server-side API, added user authentiactionm and connected to a database.

## Description

Welcome to Burp, a simple application that allows users to post, follow users, and view their feed. This project was created as a demonstration of the basic social media functionality, and as such includes features like authentication, message creation, display, and user likes and comments. 


## Features
    -User Authentication: users can sign up and log in to the application. 
    -Message creation: users can create and post messages. 
    -User Profiles: users have their own profile pages, displaying their messages. 
    -Save features: users can like other posts. 
    -Feed: users can view their feed, which consists of the messages/posts of the users they follow.
